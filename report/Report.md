# DevSecOps Assessment Project – Security & Compliance Report

## 1️⃣ Overview
This report summarizes the security, hardening, and compliance measures implemented for the Node.js/Express application with MongoDB backend deployed on Kubernetes (Minikube/EKS simulation).

The project includes:
- Secure containerization
- CI/CD pipeline security
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- Kubernetes hardening
- Observability/monitoring (optional)

---

## 2️⃣ Docker Image Security

**Image:** `node-app:latest`  
**Scan Tool:** Trivy  

**Findings:**
- [ ] Minor vulnerabilities in Node.js Alpine base image (low/medium severity)
- [ ] No high or critical vulnerabilities in custom app code

**Hardening Implemented:**
- Multi-stage Docker build  
- Minimal base image (`node:18-alpine`)  
- Non-root user specified  
- Copied only required files (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`)  

**Pending Risks / Recommendations:**
- Regularly update base image to patch new vulnerabilities  
- Consider using Distroless image for extra security  

---

## 3️⃣ CI/CD Pipeline Security

**Tools Used:** GitHub Actions, Trivy, Semgrep  

**Hardening Implemented:**
- Container scanning in pipeline  
- Static code analysis for security  
- Pipeline fails on critical vulnerabilities  

**Pending Risks:**
- Add secrets scanning for sensitive environment variables  
- Integrate automated remediation for detected issues  

---

## 4️⃣ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

**Tools Used:** Terraform, Checkov, tfsec  

**Hardening Implemented:**
- Defined VPC, subnets, IAM roles, EKS cluster, and node groups  
- Terraform validated successfully  
- Security checks with Checkov/tfsec  

**Pending Risks:**
- Map modules to actual AWS security groups before real deployment  
- Add automated IAM policy validation  

---

## 5️⃣ Kubernetes Hardening

**Cluster:** Minikube (EKS simulation)  

**Implemented:**
- Deployments, Services, NetworkPolicy, PodDisruptionBudget  
- PodSecurityContext (non-root, privilege escalation disabled)  
- Resource limits and requests defined  
- Namespace isolation via NetworkPolicy  

**Pending Risks / Recommendations:**
- Enable RBAC roles for production  
- Use Secrets for sensitive information  
- Add PodSecurity admission controller in real EKS  

---

## 6️⃣ Observability & Monitoring

**Tools Used:** Prometheus, Grafana  

**Implemented:**
- Monitoring manifests for node metrics and app metrics  
- Alerts for pod restarts and high CPU  

**Pending Risks:**
- Integrate alert notifications to Slack/email for production  
- Enable persistent storage for Prometheus metrics

## 7️⃣ Summary

| Area                       | Status                       | Pending Actions |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| Docker Image                | Hardened, scanned             | Keep base image updated |
| CI/CD Pipeline              | Security checks enabled       | Add secret scanning |
| Terraform IaC               | Validated and scanned         | Map to real AWS IAM/SG |
| Kubernetes Hardening        | PodSecurity & resources set   | Enable RBAC, Secrets |
| Observability & Monitoring  | Basic metrics and alerts      | Add notifications and persistent storage |

> Overall, the deployment is **production-ready** for simulation purposes. Minor improvements are suggested for full production-grade security.
