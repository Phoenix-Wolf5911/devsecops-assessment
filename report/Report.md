# DevSecOps Assessment Project – Security & Compliance Report

## 1️⃣ Overview
This report summarizes the security, hardening, and compliance measures implemented for the Node.js/Express application with MongoDB and Kubernetes deployment.

The project includes:
- Secure containerization
- CI/CD pipeline security
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- Kubernetes hardening
- Observability/monitoring (optional)

---

## 2️⃣ Docker Image Security

**Image:** `nodeapp-secure:latest`  
**Base OS:** Alpine 3.21.3  
**Scan Tool:** Trivy  

**Findings:**
- 12 vulnerabilities found in the base Alpine image (no high or critical severity).
- All Node.js dependencies reported **0 vulnerabilities**.
- No secrets detected in the image.

**Hardening Implemented:**
- Used multi-stage build to minimize attack surface.
- Chose minimal base image (`node:18-alpine`).
- Configured container to run as a non-root user.
- Removed unnecessary packages and build tools after installation.

**Risk Assessment:**
- All detected vulnerabilities are from upstream Alpine packages.
- No direct impact on the Node.js app layer.
- Marked as **low to medium risk**.

**Next Steps / Recommendations:**
- Periodically rebuild the image to pull latest Alpine updates.
- Integrate Trivy scanning into CI/CD to auto-block critical vulnerabilities.
- Consider using **Distroless base image** in future builds for extra hardening.

## 3️⃣ CI/CD Pipeline Security

**Tools Used:** GitHub Actions, Trivy, Semgrep

**Hardening Implemented:**
- Container scanning in pipeline
- Static code analysis for security
- Pipeline fails on critical vulnerabilities

**Pending Risks:**
- Add secrets scanning for sensitive environment variables
- Integrate automated remediation for detected issues

---

## 4️⃣ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

**Tools Used:** Terraform, Checkov, tfsec

**Hardening Implemented:**
- Defined VPC, subnets, IAM roles, EKS cluster, and node groups
- Terraform validated successfully
- Security checks with Checkov/tfsec

**Pending Risks:**
- Map modules to actual AWS security groups before real deployment
- Add automated IAM policy validation

---

## 5️⃣ Kubernetes Hardening

**Cluster:** Minikube (EKS simulation)

**Implemented:**
- Deployments, Services, NetworkPolicy, PodDisruptionBudget
- PodSecurityContext (non-root, privilege escalation disabled)
- Resource limits and requests defined
- Namespace isolation via NetworkPolicy

**Pending Risks / Recommendations:**
- Enable RBAC roles for production
- Use Secrets for sensitive information
- Add PodSecurity admission controller in real EKS

---

## 6️⃣ Observability & Monitoring

**Tools Used:** Prometheus, Grafana

**Implemented:**
- Monitoring manifests for node metrics and app metrics
- Alerts for pod restarts and high CPU

**Pending Risks:**
- Integrate alert notifications to Slack/email for production
- Enable persistent storage for Prometheus metrics

## 7️⃣ Summary

| Area                       | Status                       | Pending Actions |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| Docker Image                | Hardened, scanned             | Keep base image updated |
| CI/CD Pipeline              | Security checks enabled       | Add secret scanning |
| Terraform IaC               | Validated and scanned         | Map to real AWS IAM/SG |
| Kubernetes Hardening        | PodSecurity & resources set   | Enable RBAC, Secrets |
| Observability & Monitoring  | Basic metrics and alerts      | Add notifications and persistent storage |

> Overall, the deployment is **production-ready** for simulation purposes. Minor improvements are suggested for full production readiness.
